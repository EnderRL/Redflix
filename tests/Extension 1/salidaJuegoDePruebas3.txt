translating negated cond for predicate DESIREDCONTENT
translating negated cond for predicate ASIGNEDCONTENT
no metric specified.

task contains conditional effects. turning off state domination.



ff: search configuration is Enforced Hill-Climbing, if that fails then best-first search.
Metric is plan length.
NO COST MINIMIZATION (and no cost-minimizing relaxed plans).

Enforced Hill-climbing failed !
switching to Best-first Search now.
